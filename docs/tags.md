# Tags Guidelines

We ask contributors to follow some directives about **tags**

## Summary

* Create a tag.
* Respecting the naming

## Prerequisites

* Make sure you have an Azure DevOps account.

## Naming convention

**Important** In order to name a tag, please respect the semantic versioning present in the following format *vX.Y.Z*
**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**

* The first number (MAJOR or X) is the version number, when you make incompatible API changes. This corresponds to a breaking change that is not backward compatible.
* The second number (MINOR or Y) is the version number, when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner.
* The third number (PATCH or Z) is the version number, when you make backwards compatible bug fixes or patches.

## Create a tag

* In order to create a tag, on Azure DevOps, you should type a name of the tag and a description.

    > Please respect the semantic versioning in the format vX.Y.Z

* Please select a branch in which you want to associate the tag.

* Then, you should to make a description of the tag, in order to describe what it corresponds to explain the corrections, and explain what is present in the new version.
